## Optimization engine selection
## Currently configured options:
## CPLEX, Cbc, SCIP, HiGHS, and GLPK
solver: cbc

## Verbosity level of the program's output
verbose: 3

## Parameters
##
forms:

## Assembly model (TIC, TIC2, TCC, or CTT)
## TIC  - Test Information with absolute target at K points in theta
## TIC2 - Maximize relative information at specified points
## TIC3 - Maximize relative target, one per test
## TCC  - Test Characteristic Curve, absolute at Theta/Tau (Preequating)
## CTT  - Classic Test Theory (currently not available)
     method: TIC

## Use Big Shadow Test heuristic; assemble one test at a time
## insted of all test simultaneously (shadowTest: 0).
## Recommended as defaut, specially for big or complex models.
## Required if TCC3 method is selected to alternate forms
## 1 use Big Shadow Test sequential assembly
## 0 simultaneous assembly
     shadowTest: 0
     F: 5           # Number of test forms to assemble

## Number of anchor tests to alternate in forms from those
## included in the anchorFile. When an acchor test is not
## included, the items are excluded from assembly.
     anchorTests: 0

## Number of powers for the TCC equating model
     R: 2

## Points on the scale for equating (including cut points)
     theta: [-2.5, -1.2, 0.0, 1.2, 2.5, 3.5]

## Score probabilities in the reference test to match at K theta points
## If tau is not set, it will be calculated as the average prob from the
## item bank. The number of rows should be the same as R, (1,2,...) separated by
## semicolons.
     ## tau: [15.18 24.32 34.05 43.46 51.81; 4.82 11.85 21.72 33.39 45.64]

## Information in the reference test to match at K theta points
## If tau_info is not set, it will be calculated as the average from the
## item bank
     ## tau_info: []

## Points and weights to maximize for relative target models
## TIC2 and TIC3
     relativeTargetWeights: [1, 1, 1]
     relativeTargetPoints: [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
