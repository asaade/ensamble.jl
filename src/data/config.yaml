## Inputs
itemsFile: ./data/items.csv               # Item bank data file
constraintsFile: ./data/constraints.csv   # Constraints file
anchorFile: ./data/ancla.csv              # Anchor items file

## Outputs
versionsFile: ./data/results/versions.csv # File to store assembled test versions
tccFile: ./data/results/tcc.csv           # Test Characteristic Curve (TCC) file
resultsFile: ./data/results/results.csv   # File to store final results
plotFile: ./data/results/chart.png        # Plot output file

## Optimization engine selection
## Currently configured options:
## CPLEX, Cbc, SCIP, HiGHS, and GLPK
solver: cplex

## Number of anchor tests to alternate from those
## included in the anchorFile. If an acchor test is not
## included, the items are reused as standard items.
anchorNumber: 4

## Verbosity level of the program's output
verbose: 1

## Parameters
##
forms:
     F: 2           # Number of test versions to assemble

## Assembly model (TIC, TIC2, TCC, or CTT)
## TIC  - Test Information with absolute target at K points in theta
## TIC2 - Maximize relative information at specified points
## TIC3 - Maximize relative target, one per test
## TCC  - Test Characteristic Curve, absolute at Theta/Tau
## CTT  - Classic Test Theory (currently not functional)
     method: TCC

## Number of powers for the TCC equating model
     R: 3

## Points on the scale for equating (including cut points)
     theta: [-2.5, -1.2, 0.0, 1.2, 2.5]

## Score probabilities in the reference test to match at K theta points
## If tau is not set, it will be calculated as the average from the
## item bank. The number of rows should be the same as R, all separated by
## a semicolon.
     ## tau: [15.18 24.32 34.05 43.46 51.81; 4.82 11.85 21.72 33.39 45.64]

## Information in the reference test to match at K theta points
## If tau_info is not set, it will be calculated as the average from the
## item bank
     ## tau_info: []


## Use Big Shadow Test heuristic; assemble one test at a time
## insted of all test simultaneously (shadowSize: 0) to easy
## Recommended as defaut, specially for big or complex models.
## Required if TCC3 method is selected to alternate forms
     shadowSize: 1

## Points and weights to maximize for relative target models
## TIC2 and TIC3
     relativeTargetWeights: [1, 1, 1]
     relativeTargetPoints: [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
